Comments are non executable statemnets. They are not executed by the compiler or interpreter.
They are two types of Comments
(a) Single Line
(b) Multi line
We use the comments to explain the function desc, parameters,etc. They make code understand not only for us when we revisit it after
some time but also for everyone try to read the code.

(a) Single Line comments

These commenents are represented by //

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    //Declaring a int varibale
    int a = 5;
    //print the declared variable
    cout<<a;
    return 0;
}
```

Multi line commnets are represented by /*.....*/

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    /*Declare a variable and 
    print a variable in C++*/

    int a=5;
    cout<<a;
    retrun 0;
}
```
